Sorry for putting the packages in random places since I cannot put packages into another package
For example, I created a skillbuilder package in order to store the 'Puck' and 'Rectangle' packages
but for some reason it won't allow me to do that. So I added what type of assignment it was whether 
it would be a skillbuilder or mastery after the java class package name. :)
